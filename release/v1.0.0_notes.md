# Release v1.0.0

🎉 **First Official Release!**

We are excited to introduce **Site Storage Cleaner**, the ultimate tool for developers and power users to manage browser storage with precision. This extension allows you to selectively clear cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB, and more for specific websites, without affecting your entire browsing history.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🎯 Selective Clearing**: Build a list of "Managed Sites" and clear storage only for those domains.
*   **🧹 Comprehensive Cleaning**: Clears all major storage types:
    *   Cookies (including subdomains)
    *   LocalStorage & SessionStorage
    *   IndexedDB
    *   Service Worker Caches
*   **🖱️ Multiple Ways to Clear**:
    *   **Popup**: Quick "Clear This Site" button in the extension menu.
    *   **Floating Button**: Optional on-page button for one-click access.
    *   **Context Menu**: Right-click anywhere on a page to clear storage.
    *   **Auto-Clear**: Automatically wipe storage every time you visit a managed site (great for testing!).
*   **⚙️ Flexible Settings**:
    *   Toggle specific storage types (e.g., keep cookies but clear localStorage).
    *   Import/Export your list of managed sites.
    *   Dark mode compatible UI.
